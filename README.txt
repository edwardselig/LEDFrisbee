For my final project in embedded systems I created a frisbee that has LEDs on it that changes colors based
on how fast the disc is rotating.  When i presented my project to hundreds of kids at UB's CS education week
a lot of parents and kids thought it was really cool and told me they would buy it.  After the project was
handed in i have continued to improve my project and i have created a cheaper, marketable model that i plan
on trying to sell to retailers.  I am on the Ultimate Frisbee team at my school so this project combined two
of my interests, frisbee and computer engineering.  I have enjoyed working on this project and whether i can
sell it to a retailer or not it was a rewarding experience.  

I received a 100% on the project.  I derived the equations for each color range by using a linear equation that
would keep every color between 0 and 255.  I used an adafruit Trinket microprocessor, a 10 neopixel LED strip,
and a 16g accelerometer.
